We want to implement continuous integration (or something like it) for our A-F Accountability codebase. The first step in this project is determining what unit tests and validation reports should look like. Will we use the pytest library, or create our own testing framework from scratch? What statistical tests and visuals would be helpful for comparing one year's data to the previous? Since the staticfile is so large, should we create a dummy staticfile with fake data to run unit tests on, and then perform data validation on the actual staticfile? Lots of questions...

We will want to start with applying this CI framework to the StaticFile code, checking the number of records contained in the result, making sure that all of the subgroups are present, all possible performance levels are present, checking the fiscal year, checking the year of the created date, etc. Also produce some sort of report with visuals that compares distributions of subgroups, performance levels, growth categories, etc. between the current staticfile and the previous one.
